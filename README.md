# dice, a tiny guessing game</h1>
<break></break>
dice is very easy to play and run.

Simply copy/paste the code into a python playground online!
> I've found that a lot of python playgrounds will break when you try to import libraries, replit.com is the best one, and it has a full-fledged IDE.
> You can also run it using the python3 command on your computer.
> If you use linux, make the linux-install.sh script executable and run it.

Future Features:
