# dice, a tiny guessing game</h1>
<break></break>
dice is very easy to play and run.

Simply copy/paste the code into a python playground online!
> I've found that a lot of python playgrounds will break when you try to import libraries, replit.com is the best one, and it has a full-fledged IDE.

> You can also run it using the python3 command on your computer.

For Linux users:
If you want to run the game more easily, clone this repo into your downloads folder, and then make the linux-install.sh script executable (chmod +x linux-install.sh). Run the script, and then you'll be able to run it by typing "dice" into your terminal.

Future Features:
 - OSX and Windows support
 - Proper installer
 - Full graphics
 - More game modes
