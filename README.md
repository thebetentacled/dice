# dice, a tiny guessing game</h1>
<break></break>
dice is very easy to play and run.

Simply copy/paste the code into a python playground online!
> I've found that a lot of python playgrounds will break when you try to import libraries, replit.com is the best one, and it has a full-fledged IDE.

OR, you can run it using the python3 command on your computer. See python.org for downloads if you don't have it installed.
